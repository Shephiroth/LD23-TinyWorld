LD23-TinyWorld
==============

Theme: Tiny World. Is not the best, but not the worst either.

Last day i was thinking into doing a defense type game if the theme let me, and this theme 
is ok, but not sure if have enough time.

Ok, ill try it either way. First lets make the environment. LWJGL + Slick + Applet.
Ill make it application + applet, but native thing is hard to control to release it 
as program. Ill see what i make about that at the end. For now, application for dev and 
applet for release.

Oh, one more thing before first commit. Im going to commit every hour or so, it will help me 
keep the code in place and be able to remove/paste code.
