LD23-TinyWorld
==============

  POLISHING BRANCH
====================

A new branch means new rules. This is not for LD23 anymore, but for myself. There are things that i didnt have time to do, but now i want to do them to actually finish it. 

If you follow my commits you already now that the most annoing thing for me during all LD was the time. Maybe this was too big for a first entry, and i realized too late to change but too soon to bother me.

Im planning to enter next ludum dare, but before that i must close this episode, and for that i must finish the full project. That means adding all i wanted from start:

1- I wanted long-range and short-range weapons (probably you noticed sword on graphics).
2- I wanted the levels to work in a different way. Rather than spawning all mobs and start the fight, i wanted them to spawn from outside the "seen area".
3- Flowers aint there for nothing. I wanted to have yet another resource (energy) with make the dual thing (sword-bow) more complex (bow need energy to use).
4- Didnt have time to polish code. I must be realistic, there are things that only take 5 mins to fix but didnt notice myself:
  * Cant use shop during levels (very easy task if merge gameoverTick() with general tick())
  * There is no info/credits page.
  * There is no real win condition.
  * There is no balance in enemy/player/upgrades att/def.
  * Enemies lvl 0 are useless....no dmg, no score (hence no gold/exp).
5- Last thing i wanted to achieve is the mechanics about "losing space". Right now it get smaller from level to level, but nothing change in actual level.
6- The only real goal is unlock and win the last level (8*8), but thats no fun.
7- The last and probably the most desired one, better AI from enemies. Im no expert and never intended to do a big AI, but random direction and random fire.....sucks, i know.
8- More like 7.2. I wanted to give zombies a real task.....kill player, or destroy flowers, or destroy "place here your ad".

Thats all........yeah, "all" :)
